# Digit-Recognition
This module can be used to recognize handwritten digits in python using Machine Learning Library called Scikit Learn(or Sklearn).
 
Other libraries used are : Numpy, Matplotlib(plotting the image), Pandas(to load the training datasets).

The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray scale images of hand-drawn digits from zero to nine.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel value is an integer between 0 to 255,inclusive.

NOTE:- Make sure that the datasets.zip file is extracted within the same directory where the original repository file prediction was extracted.
